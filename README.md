# proceduralSpaltedMapleWoodgrain
This P5.js sketch uses Perlin noise to generate a stretched camouflage pattern, then runs a simple edge detection on that. Click final image to save a PNG which you can then either raster etch or trace to quickly vector etch a Spalted Maple pattern.

FUTURE WORK: The next step (which I couldn't get working yet) is to interface imagetracerjs or potracejs to export an SVG of the traced value directly.
