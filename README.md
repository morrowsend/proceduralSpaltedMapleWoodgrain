# proceduralSpaltedMapleWoodgrain
This P5.js sketch uses Perlin noise to generate a stretched camouflage pattern, then runs a simple edge detection on that. Click final image to save a PNG which you can then either raster etch or trace to quickly vector etch a Spalted Maple pattern.

Inspired by a design I saw on imgur.
